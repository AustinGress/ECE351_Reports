\section{Introduction}
 
In this lab we received numerous tasks around the idea of creating functions. We will learn to manipulate tools in numpy to plot and display graphs. We will then create simple functions, i.e. ramp and step functions r(t) and u(t), and use them to model a graph. Then taking it a step further we will find the derivative of said graph. 

I challenge the reader to try and make the delta function in their free time. It is a good way to get more acquainted with the program and receive a better understanding.

\section{Equations}

\[
    r(t)= 
\begin{cases}
    t, & \text{if } x\geq 0 \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\[
    u(t)= 
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if } x\geq 0 \\
    0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\begin{equation} \label{Derivative}
\frac{dy}{dx} = \lim\limits_{h\to \infty} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{Function Plot for Part 2}
y(t) = r(t)-r(t-3)+5u(t-3)-2u(t-6)-2r(t-6)
\end{equation}

\section{Methodology}

The first task to complete is plotting the function y = cos(t) using numpy. You are already given code from the previous section of the lab. The given code is plotting a sine function. 

The next task is using creating the ramp and step function so that we can display 'Figure 2'. The second thing you will need to do is define what the function is using r(t) and u(t). I then used another definition that used the equation I wrote to implement the plot. Be careful in this section because we tend to imply multiplication. Also the previous time dimensions wont work and we will need to redefine t. Where we place it also matters because the function definition needs to use it before it passes it off. Example of said methodology is on the next page. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
#%% Example Code Methodology
def Funct2(t):
    y = r(t)-r(t-3)+5*u(t-3)-2*u(t-6)-2*r(t-6)
    return y
    
steps = 1e-4
t = np.arange(-5, 15+steps, steps)
y = Funct2(t)

#%% Before you set y equal to the output of the function you need to change the time parameters.

\end{lstlisting}

Finally we want to display that the function can be time reversed, shifted, and scaled and we need to plot the derivative.
\textit{Make sure to include hand drawn graph of the derivative. \textbf{See back for graphs}}

\section{Results}

The lab was easy once you took the time to understand the coding. In the time we spend doing the labs, the majority of the time is spent understanding how the code works and implementing it. 

The derivative part of the lab was the most \textit{difficult} because I didn't fully understand the numpy commands used. 

When using the functions we defined to implement changes in the figure we had to plot was the most enjoyable. It went exactly how I wanted it to work without any of the annoying syntax of C++. I never understood how \textit{easy} it could be to use python in mathematics.  

\section{Error Analysis}

The only difficulties I had in this lab was due to a misunderstanding with the dimensions of t. Having to place t before using a defined function was understandable but I didn't know what was wrong until I spent quite some time trying to figure it out.

\section{Questions}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Are the plots from \textbf{Part 3 Task 4 and Part 3 Task 5} identical? Is it possible for them to match? Explain why or why not.

\textit{No they aren't identical because of the derivative of the step function being delta. This made the numpy program go until infinity.}


\item How does the correlation between the two plots (from \textbf{Part 3 Task 4} and \textbf{Part 3 Task 5}) change if you were to change the step size within the time variable in \textbf{Task 5}? Explain why this happens.

\textit{The graph wouldn't look the same. The value would go to one in the begining and step down at 3. Then at 6 it would go to one again and stay there.}


\item Leave any feedback on the clarity of lab tasks, expectations, and deliverable. 

\textit{Can we receive labs on the weekend so we have time to look over them? Didn't check this week but thought I should mention it.}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
By the end of this lab graphing and function definitions seem easy. Numpy commands are difficult to use fluently but I now have a better understanding of the material. Graphing and plotting information is also easier. Understanding high levels of mathematics still need to be studied with Python but I now have a base understanding of it.
